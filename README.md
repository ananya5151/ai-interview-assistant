# AI Interview Assistant

A voice-first technical interview app built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the AI SDK (Google Gemini). It speaks each question, auto-records your answer, evaluates it, and moves to the next question until the interview completes.

## Features

- Voice-first interview flow (speech synthesis + recognition), auto-timed answers per difficulty
- 6-question set (2 easy, 2 medium, 2 hard) generated by AI with static fallback
- Provisional local scoring shown immediately; background model evaluation patches final score/feedback
- Resume extraction (name, email, phone) from PDF/DOC/DOCX/TXT
- In-memory last-session summary for interviewer dashboard; no persistent history

## Live demo / Deploy options


## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (Next.js 14 requirement)
- pnpm or npm (examples use pnpm)
- A Google Generative AI API key in `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`

## Quickstart (local)

1. Create a `.env.local` file at the project root based on `.env.example` and set your API key.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the dev server.

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local to add your key

pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Build for production

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Note: `next.config.mjs` disables type and ESLint checks during builds and sets images.unoptimized for simpler deploys.

## Environment variables

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` (required): Your Gemini API key used by API routes under `app/api/*` (generate-questions, evaluate, extract, summary).

Create `.env.local` for local dev. Vercel users should set this in Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables.

## Deploy to Vercel (recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, import the project from GitHub.
3. Set Environment Variable: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY = <your key>`.
4. Deploy. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and build.

The app uses Next.js App Router API routes and requires no additional server config. Analytics via `@vercel/analytics` is already wired.

## Deploy to Vercel (step-by-step)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, import the project from GitHub.
3. Set Environment Variable: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY = <your key>`.
4. Click Deploy. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and builds.

## Notes and tips

- Microphone permissions: The app uses the Web Speech API and MediaRecorder; allow mic access when prompted.
- If evaluation is rate-limited, a provisional local score is shown and the model score may patch later.
- Resume uploads over ~7MB are rejected for performance.

## Troubleshooting

- Empty questions or speech timing race: We set all 6 questions atomically and pass explicit text to the speaker to avoid races.
- Repeated words in transcripts: We throttle interim recognition updates and diff interim text; if a specific browser still duplicates heavily, open an issue with your browser/version.
- Model JSON failures/rate limits: API routes use defensive parsing and heuristic fallbacks.
